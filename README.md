This template will deploy the following components:

- Ubuntu 18.04 VM with GateSentry Proxy Installed

You can login to the admin portal of GateSentry by going to http://IP-address-of-Linux-VM:10786 and logging in using the default credentials of "admin/admin".

### Still in development

- Windows Server 2016 Client VM
- Azure Bastion Service used to connect to the servers

The automated install will download the certificate from GateSentry and install it in the trusted root store on the Windows VM, and then configure the proxy settings on the Windows VM).
